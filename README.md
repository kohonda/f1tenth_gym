# The F1TENTH Gym environment

This is the repository of the F1TENTH Gym environment.

This project is still under heavy developement.

You can find the [documentation](https://f1tenth-gym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) of the environment here.

## Tested Native Environment
- Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS)
- with only CPU

## Quickstart

<details>
<summary>Docker Installation</summary>

### Install Docker

[Installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)

```bash
# Install from get.docker.com
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

### Setup GPU for Docker
[Installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
    sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list 

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit nvidia-container-runtime

sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker

sudo systemctl restart docker
```
</details>

### Setup with Docker

NOTE: Currently, tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with CPU-only.

```bash
# build container (without GPU support)
make build-cpu
# or build container (with GPU support)
# make build-gpu
```

Open remote container via Vscode (Recommend)
1. Open the folder using vscode
2. Ctrl+P and select 'devcontainer rebuild and reopen in container'
Then, you can skip the following commands

```bash
# [Optional] Run container via terminal (without GPU support)
make bash-cpu
# Or Run container via terminal (with GPU support)
# make bash-gpu
```


Then you can run a quick waypoint follow example by:
```bash
cd examples
python3 waypoint_follow.py
```

## Known issues
- Library support issues on Windows. You must use Python 3.8 as of 10-2021
- On MacOS Big Sur and above, when rendering is turned on, you might encounter the error:
```
ImportError: Can't find framework /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework.
```
You can fix the error by installing a newer version of pyglet:
```bash
$ pip3 install pyglet==1.5.11
```
And you might see an error similar to
```
gym 0.17.3 requires pyglet<=1.5.0,>=1.4.0, but you'll have pyglet 1.5.11 which is incompatible.
```
which could be ignored. The environment should still work without error.
